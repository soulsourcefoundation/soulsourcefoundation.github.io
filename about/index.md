## Our History

Since its inception, the focus of the Soul Source Foundation has remained on women and girls and specifically in western Kenya in the Lake Victoria, Rusinga Island area through education and empowerment.

In 2008, the Soul Source Foundation was created by a group of seven people in memory of **Rev. Carleton Peterson**. This group (<b>Dr. Elaine R. Millam</b>, <b>Dr. Theodora Ayot</b>, <b>Dennis Coyne</b>, <b>Eileen Page</b>, <b>Judy Peterson</b>, <b>Naomi Tutu</b>, and <b>Tom VerDoorn</b>) was inspired by Peterson's LLC. 

The intent in creating the Soul Source Foundation, was to continue the mission of Sole Source, LLC by supporting women’s empowerment strategies and programs in African communities as well as other countries or communities where women were in need of education, training and other opportunities. The goal of was to provide services that included micro-lending, spiritual retreats, empowerment training and intentional connections with women trained to offer spiritual, emotional, and financial support. From 2006 to 2010, the work of first Sole Source, LLC and later Soul Source Foundation, focused on supporting women’s empowerment groups in Kenya and South Africa, which was largely due to the friendship formed with North Park University professor Dr. Theodora Ayot whose home is Rusinga Island.

In 2010, a group of Professor Ayot’s former students took her up on offer to visit her home of Rusinga Island and later initiated the Operation My People secondary scholarship program (OMP). It began at Kamasengre Mixed Secondary School as a way to help ensure the opportunity of a quality education for young girls in the community who wouldn’t otherwise have the resources or support to attend secondary school.

With the inclusion of new board members we made the decision to work specifically in western Kenya in order to maximize our impact and efficiency. Along with the increased focus on preparing trainers to reach groups for Empowerment Training, the OMP scholarship program expanded to support 40 students and has done so each year subsequently.

Several students have gone onto to pursue post-secondary education as a result of having access to an uninterrupted high school education and Soul Source continues to sponsor a new young woman from Rusinga Island each year for her studies in college or University. Already more than 60 students have completed four years of secondary school through the OMP program and 4 have earned degrees or diplomas with our sponsorship.
